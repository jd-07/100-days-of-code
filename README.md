I've joined the 
# _100 Days Of Code Challenge !_

- [_Log <- Checkout my progress here_](https://github.com/jd-07/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md)

# Rules
1. Code for minimum an hour a day for the next 100 days.
2. Tweet My progress daily with hashtag **#100DaysOfCode**. [Checkout my tweets here](https://twitter.com/Jd_077)
3. Update your progress in github repo of 10days of code. [Here is mine](https://github.com/jd-07/100-days-of-code)
4. Each day reach out to at least two people on twitter who are also doing the challenge.

# The Next Step
Formulate what you want to work on during the challenge. It might be - learning a framework, or starting a journey of learning to code, or improving your skill level with a particular technology or a programming language. Don’t spend too much time planning, but having a plan like this will help you on your path.

# Resources
- checkout this [resources](https://www.100daysofcode.com/resources)
- Fork Fork this [Github repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code) and commit to the Log daily. Follow the instructions in the repo.
- Follow [100DaysOfCode Twitter Bot](https://twitter.com/_100DaysOfCode) that retweets all the tweets that contain the #100DaysOfCode hashtag. It’s a great way to keep yourself motivated and to participate in the community.
- Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It’s also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple people right away. 
- If you find a great, helpful resource that others would benefit from, either submit a Pull Request to add it to the repo.
