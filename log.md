# 100-days-of-code 
### date- 21/08/2020
### Today I have commited to 100-days-of-code. 
from today onwards I will do atleast 1hour of code for next 100days.

## DAY:1 21 AUGUST 2020, FRI DAY
#### Today's Progress   
wrap my head around dynamic memory allocation, pointers, refference and stack frames.
read about it from geeks for geeks/ c++/ pointers and book- computer science with c++ by sumita arora.

## DAY:2 22 AUGUST 2020, SATUR DAY
#### Today's Progress   
Today I have worked on Data Structures.
I went through singly linked list. Learned the basics and able to implement it in some problems related to insertion(at beggining of list, End and Desired place), Deletion and some manipulation questions. Reffered [geeksforgeeks singly linked list data structure](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/linked-list/#singlyLinkedList).
#### Thoughts
Firstly I got stuck at handling pointer objects for the structure node of linkedlist but, gradually learnt and managed to use it properly.

## DAY:3 23 AUGUST 2020, SUN DAY
#### Today's Progress   
learnt stackFrame and in continuation to #Day02 worked on some linked list problems.
#### Thoughts
Get to know what's going on behind the scene while compilation and execution.

[stack frame](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/22304/stack-frame#:~:text=A%20stack%20frame%20is%20a%20memory%20management%20technique,frames%20are%20only%20existent%20during%20the%20runtime%20process.)


## DAY:4 24 AUGUST 2020, MON DAY
#### Today's Progress   
solved problems on codechef DSA learning series-contest 1 complexity analysis and basic warmup.
#### thought
very interesting problems !!
