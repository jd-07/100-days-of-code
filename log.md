### Today I have commited to 100-days-of-code. 

## Day-01 <07/09/2020, MonDay>
### Todays Progress
gone through Bitwise operators, solved questions on bits manipulation.
solved some really interesting questions like.
1. detecting even/ odd using bitwise operators.
2. finding number of ones in binary representation.
3. finding all possible subset of given set.
4. finding maximum consecutive ones in binary representation.
set, not set bits nad some more realted problems.

### Link To Work
[Bit Manipulation](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/basic-programming/bit-manipulation/basics-of-bit-manipulation/tutorial/)
both theories and problems.
