### Todays Progress
gone through Bitwise operators, solved questions on bits manipulation.
solved some really interesting questions like.
1. detecting even/ odd using bitwise operators.
2. finding number of ones in binary representation.
3. finding all possible subset of given set.
4. finding maximum consecutive ones in binary representation.
set, not set bits nad some more realted problems.

both theories and problems.

### Todays Progress
learnt the theries of circular linked list. Implemented it solving some problems like - splitting the circular list into two circular lists, sorted insert in circular list, checking whether its circular or not . . .
practiced some more problems of linear Data Structures on dsa learning series codechef.
